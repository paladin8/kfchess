                        Kung Fu Chess is a variant of chess designed for the internet age. It brings the real-time strategy aspect
                        of games like StarCraft, Command & Conquer, and Age of Empires to a classic setting. It was originally
                        released in 2002 by Shizmoo Games and was popular through the mid-2000s. This is a reinvention of the game
                        using modern technology and game design to bring out its potential. I hope you enjoy playing!
